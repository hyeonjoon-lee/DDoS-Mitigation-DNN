# DDoS-Mitigation-DNN

Using a Bidirectional LSTM-RNN model to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks.
Datasets hping_attack.csv and hping_normal.csv created from analyzing packets generated by hping3.

For training on real datasets, refer to https://gitlab.com/santhisenan/ids_iscx_2012_dataset by A. Santhisenan.

When loading the .h5 models on mininet and sending hping3 packet data as inputs, 
must run ddos_free.py or ddos_free_2.py in advance to properly scale the raw data packets.
